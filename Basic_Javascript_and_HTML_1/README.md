#4682B4# TTA-HTML-and-CSS-projects
This README is for the basic html and javascript practice work.
I will give each site and general folder their own READMEs
I am learning how to navigate and use github and it looks like I need to run the sites under root.
I will always have folders for organization and structure but the site I am actively working on will have an empty folder to be put into once I am finished
This is for the sake of keeping html and css projects under this repo. 
Otherwise I will make new repositories but the course has not instructed me to do that for the basic html and javascript portion of the course.
