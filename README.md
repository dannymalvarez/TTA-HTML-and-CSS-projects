# TTA-HTML-and-CSS-projects
This is my repo for HTML and CSS projects for TTA in the HTML and CSS course.
This repo contains folders that have site files within them. In order to display them you would need to open a live preview or have them hosted in their own repo to use GitHub pages. 
The projects in this repo are:
- Assignment_cat_dog_video_files: This was practice of adding pictures and videos to a site. Among other intro practice for tags.
- Basic_HTML_and_CSS: This was a folder for basic HTML and CSS principles to be practiced and seen in action.
- Basic_Javascript_and_HTML_1: This was a brief intro into some basic JS integration into HTML using <script>
- bootstrap4_project: This was an intro to bootstrap, I enjoyed this very much. 
- Final_Challenges: This folder houses the files for the challenges in the latter portion of the HTML and CSS course for The Tech Academy. These are a  little messy as I was applying the challenges to existing bits of code as I played around with the concepts. 
- Final_Project: This folder now only holds the copied files from The Tech Academy as a walk through to building a portfolio website. I moved the functioning files into their own repo to have them hosted on GitHub.
- One_Page_Website: This folder holds files to a single website to show principles and basics
- Quick html assignment: This folde was for quick tasks from the course
- Space Site Project: This folder was for a couple of the first websites that the course had me follow along. One is customized with my dog, Sally, as the focus and the other is a direct copy of the instructor. 
- Start_files: This folder holds starter files for a simple website, simply an index.html and a blank.css
- Text_Site: This folder holds a couple files per a course assignment that were to practice using the terminal in VSCode.
